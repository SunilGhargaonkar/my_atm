# ATM Machine Scenarios

<p>
This project is intended to practice latest java features so I just happened to use basic ATM machine logic for this.

This project has originally created in year 2019 then I have modified and updated code as per features until java 17.
The original code or unit tests demonstrates various features from Java 8 to Java 17 e.g. Lambda Expression, Stream API, Switch Expression, Text Blocks, Record, and Sealed Class etc.

## How to run it

```
Run ATM main method to execute the program
```
